# PiLR Definition Files

This repository hosts various publicly available definition files that can be used to setup projects and components on the PiLR platform.  When wanting to import a component from one of these files, you can simply point the platform to the URL of the file, and it will fetch the JSON content from it.

Definition files are sorted into folders by their instrument code. Inside each instrument folder is a README describing the features provided by each definition in that folder.
