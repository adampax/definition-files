This file will create an instrument for the project named "EZ Physical Activity Tracker App".  That instrument will have two "Instrument Settings" for it.  It also will add a single dataset to the project.

```
Instrument Settings:
  Minimum time between records (seconds)
  Confidence level (%)
```

```
Dataset:
  Activity data
```

## Instrument Settings

```
boolean_setting
date_setting
double_setting
enum_setting
configuration_setting
integer_setting
string_setting
time_setting
```
